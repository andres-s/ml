ML
==

A toy library of machine learning algorithms implemented in `numpy` for Andrew Ng's [machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml). Not for production.

Currently has implementations for:
* Neural networks (multilayer perceptron)
* Collaborative filtering.

There are unit tests, but I haven't set up a unit test runner, so they have to be run individually:
```bash
$ python ml/algorithms/test_neural_networks.py
$ python ml/algorithms/collab_filter_test.py
```
